A: Privacy scores below 100 indicate areas for improvement:
- Check for external requests in the dashboard
- Review privacy alerts for specific issues
- Ensure all protection features are enabled
- Verify compliance settings are configured correctly

**Q: PrivAgent Pro seems to be blocking legitimate website functionality. What should I do?**
